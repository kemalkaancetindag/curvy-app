# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.

# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Gilroy
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/gilroy/Gilroy-Light.ttf
          weight: 300
        - asset: assets/fonts/gilroy/Gilroy-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400
        - asset: assets/fonts/gilroy/Gilroy-Medium.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: assets/fonts/gilroy/Gilroy-SemiBold.ttf
          weight: 600
